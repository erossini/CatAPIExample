# CatAPIExample
The task is to create an application that accepts a category and shows results based on that category.
Here are the two API endpoints that can be used.

- http://thecatapi.com/api/categories/list
- http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=xml&results_per_page={page_count}&category={category_name}

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am a user running the application

**And** I see a list of Categories

**When** I select a Category

**Then** I see images related to that category
